My First Naive Chain - Simple Blockchain


Disclaimer: I tried Lauri Hartikka's tutorial on Naive Chain. This is very close to his original code,
was more a starting point for me to shift from blockchain theory to practice.
I learned alot of fundamentals, however I highly reccomend reading Nakamoto's whitepaper on blockchain before starting
 
 It helped me alot being able to write my own comment explanations and renaming some of the methods.
 
 Good luck
